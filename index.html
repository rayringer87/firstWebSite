    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
 <p>I might be new to web development, but I've learned a lot so far.</p>   
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p>I've learned to manage code and repositories on GitHub. This allows me to be able to work on my projects anywhere. No more worries about losing a portable drive!</p>
    <h3>Basic HTML</h3>
    <p>I've also learned to write some of the most common HTML tags, and to write HTML for structure not appearance. Some of the tags that I've learned include headings(), paragraphs, and lists. I've also learned to use special entity characters.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Things</h3>
    <p>The things I like best about this class are:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Everything is hands-on, which is great practice.</li>
     <li>Learning to use GitHub</li>
     <li>Very helpful instruction</li>
    </ol>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>I'm excited to learn more so that I can:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Become more comfortable with coding</li>
     <li>Make web pages</li>
     <li>See what fun new things there are in HTML</li>
    </ul>
